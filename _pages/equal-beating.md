You're likely here because you saw [my video](https://youtu.be/M9u-AaBqd2I){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} about the advantages of an equal-beating temperament.

Here are all the intervals you heard in the video and other useful links.

## Just/perfect/mathematical intervals

**Note:** the terms "Just" and "perfect" are interchangeable, since they refer to the mathematical or theoretical proportions (3/2, 4/3 etc.).

* [Perfect 4th](/assets/equal-beating/Just 4th.mp3){: target="_blank"}

## 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) intervals
